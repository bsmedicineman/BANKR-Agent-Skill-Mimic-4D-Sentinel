# 1.1 DATA INGESTION LAYER

The system ingests data from:

### **On-Chain Sources**
- Raw swaps  
- Token transfers  
- LP adds/removes  
- Contract events  
- Wallet flows  
- MEV-sensitive activity  
- Historical chain data (full replay)  

### **Off-Chain Market Sources**
- TradingView  
- GeckoTerminal  
- DexTools  
- DexScreener  
- Birdeye  

### **Internal Predictive Models**
- 4D hyperspace timing models (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory timing signals)
- Periodicity detection  
- Wallet behavior signatures  
- Token behavior signatures  
- Predictive timing models  
- Cross-entity correlation models  

All data is normalized into a unified schema.

---

# 1.2 UNIFIED DATA MODEL (UDM)

All sources feed into a single normalized structure:

{
  "price": { 
    "tv": ..., 
    "dexscreener": ..., 
    "birdeye": ..., 
    "onchain": ...,
    "historical": { "window": "10y", "timestamp": ..., "timing_mode": "forward | reverse | delayed | anticipatory" }
  },
  "volume": { 
    "tv": ..., 
    "gecko": ..., 
    "dexscreener": ..., 
    "onchain": ...,
    "historical": { "window": "10y", "timestamp": ..., "timing_mode": "forward | reverse | delayed | anticipatory" }
  },
  "liquidity": { 
    "gecko": ..., 
    "birdeye": ..., 
    "onchain": ...,
    "historical": { "window": "10y", "timestamp": ..., "timing_mode": "forward | reverse | delayed | anticipatory" }
  },
  "wallet_flows": { 
    "birdeye": ..., 
    "onchain": ...,
    "historical": { "window": "10y", "timestamp": ..., "timing_mode": "forward | reverse | delayed | anticipatory" }
  },
  "sentiment": { 
    "dextools": ..., 
    "social": ...,
    "historical": { "window": "10y", "timestamp": ..., "timing_mode": "forward | reverse | delayed | anticipatory" }
  },
  "trend": { 
    "tv": ..., 
    "dexscreener": ...,
    "historical": { "window": "10y", "timestamp": ..., "timing_mode": "forward | reverse | delayed | anticipatory" }
  },
  "predictive": { 
    "timing": ..., 
    "periodicity": ..., 
    "bot_cycles": ...,
    "historical": { "window": "10y", "timestamp": ..., "timing_mode": "forward | reverse | delayed | anticipatory" }
  }
}

This UDM is the foundation for all higher-level intelligence.

---

# 1.3 MULTI-SOURCE MARKET INTELLIGENCE LAYER (MSMIL)

MSMIL aggregates and reconciles data from all available sources, treating every source as a general resource for any market data type (price, volume, liquidity, sentiment, wallet flows, trend, predictive signals, etc.) whenever that data is available from the source.

- TradingView (candle structure, indicators, volatility regimes)  
- GeckoTerminal (liquidity, pool composition, bonding curves)  
- DexTools (sentiment, trending tokens, whale alerts)  
- DexScreener (multi-chain price feeds, volume spikes)  
- Birdeye (Solana wallet flow, Raydium analytics)  
- On-chain RPC (raw swaps, transfers, LP events)  
- Predictive models (timing, periodicity, behavior signatures)  

MSMIL produces a weighted composite signal used by:

- Mimicry Engine  
- Synchronization Engine  
- Temporal Modulation Layer  
- Sentinel Risk Engine  
- Execution Layer  
- Learning Layer  

---

# 2. MIMICRY ENGINE

The Mimicry Engine is responsible for replicating the behavior of:

- Specific wallets  
- Specific tokens  
- Specific trading entities  
- Specific timing patterns  
- Specific liquidity behaviors  

It operates on two levels:

1. **Wallet-Level Mimicry**  
2. **Token-Level Mimicry**

Both levels are fused into a hybrid model. Every mimic action is fused with the B4NKR 4D hyperspace vector, where the X-axis explicitly encodes forward, reverse, delayed, or anticipatory timing (cross-ref: §15 Hybrid Mimicry Logic and §26 4D Hyperspace Navigation Layer for full timing integration).

---

## 2.1 WALLET-LEVEL MIMICRY

The system builds a behavioral signature for each tracked wallet:

{
  "timing_pattern": ...,
  "size_distribution": ...,
  "entry_conditions": ...,
  "exit_conditions": ...,
  "risk_profile": ...,
  "liquidity_preference": ...,
  "volatility_tolerance": ...,
  "historical_accuracy": ...
}

The behavioral signature now includes explicit 4D timing mode support (`"4d_timing_mode": "forward | reverse | delayed | anticipatory"`) that is fused into the X-axis of the hyperspace vector for every mimic action.

Wallet mimicry includes:

- Entry timing replication  
- Exit timing replication  
- Position sizing replication  
- Volatility-adjusted behavior  
- Liquidity-aware execution  
- Predictive cycle alignment  
- 4D timing replication (forward, reverse, delayed, anticipatory on X-axis)

Wallet mimicry is dynamic and continuously updated.

---

## 2.2 TOKEN-LEVEL MIMICRY

Token mimicry models:

- Price structure  
- Volume structure  
- Liquidity structure  
- Volatility regimes  
- Behavioral cycles  
- Predictive timing windows  
- Cross-token correlations  

Token mimicry outputs are fused with the B4NKR 4D hyperspace vector, where the X-axis explicitly encodes forward, reverse, delayed, or anticipatory timing for every token-level action.

Token mimicry is used to:

- Model probable future behavior patterns  
- Identify optimal entry windows  
- Identify optimal exit windows  
- Detect anomalies  
- Detect manipulation  
- Detect liquidity traps  
- Apply 4D timing replication (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory on X-axis)

---

## 2.3 HYBRID MIMICRY MODEL

The system fuses wallet-level and token-level mimicry:

hybrid_mimic = f(wallet_signature, token_signature, msmil_data, predictive_models)

The hybrid model is fused with the B4NKR 4D hyperspace vector, where the X-axis explicitly encodes forward, reverse, delayed, or anticipatory timing for every action.

This hybrid model is used by:

- Synchronization Engine  
- Temporal Modulation Layer  
- Execution Layer  
- Learning Layer

---

# 3. SYNCHRONIZATION ENGINE

The Synchronization Engine aligns the agent’s actions with:

- Wallet cycles  
- Token cycles  
- Market cycles  
- Predictive timing windows  
- Temporal modulation curves  

The Synchronization Engine also incorporates the explicit 4D timing mode from the X-axis (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory) when fusing with the hybrid mimicry output.

Synchronization is computed as:

sync_score = weighted_sum([  
  wallet_cycle_alignment,  
  token_cycle_alignment,  
  market_cycle_alignment,  
  predictive_timing_alignment,  
  temporal_modulation_alignment  
])

A high sync_score increases execution probability.  
A low sync_score suppresses execution.

Sync_score directly modulates the magnitude and X-timing component of the final 4D hyperspace vector before it reaches the Sentinel Risk Engine.

---

# 4. TEMPORAL MODULATION LAYER

This layer adjusts behavior based on:

- Time of day  
- Day of week  
- Market session  
- Predictive bot cycles  
- Historical periodicity  
- Preemptive timing windows  
- Delayed timing windows  

Temporal modulation also scales the X-axis timing mode (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory) of the final 4D hyperspace vector.

Temporal modulation modifies:

- Risk  
- Position size  
- Execution timing  
- Mimicry weights  
- Sync weights  
- 4D X-axis timing component

Example:

If predictive models detect a bot-buy cycle at 14:32 UTC, the system may:

- Increase sync weight  
- Increase mimicry weight  
- Reduce risk penalties  
- Preemptively elevate execution probability  

---

# 5. SENTINEL RISK ENGINE

The Sentinel Risk Engine is fully dynamic, fully tunable, and tied directly to real-time market data.
The engine comprises 14+ independent modules and modulates the X-axis timing component (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory) of the 4D hyperspace vector in real time.

Every risk module:

- Uses multi-source data  
- Uses dynamic thresholds  
- Uses dynamic weights  
- Uses dynamic severity curves  
- Is influenced by temporal modulation  
- Is influenced by predictive models  
- Is learnable  
- Is tunable at runtime  
- Enforces NITE token tier requirements for historical depth and full ODML intelligence access (monetization feedback loop)

---

## 5.1 DYNAMIC RISK MODULE ARCHITECTURE

Each module computes:

severity = f(data, thresholds, weights, temporal_modulation, learning)

Each module also scales the X-axis timing component (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory) of the final 4D hyperspace vector.

Where:

- data = multi-source real-time market data  
- thresholds = dynamic, learnable  
- weights = dynamic, learnable  
- temporal_modulation = time-aware adjustments  
- learning = reinforcement-driven updates  
- nite_tier = enforces $NITE holdings for full historical depth and intelligence access (monetization feedback loop)

---

## 5.2 RISK MODULE TYPES

The combined output of all Sentinel modules forms the post‑Sentinel 4D hyperspace vector, whose X‑axis timing component is resolved and expressed by the Execution Layer’s 4D Resonance Execution Bridge.

---

The Execution Layer converts the post‑Sentinel 4D hyperspace vector into on‑chain action.  
It performs:

- Entry execution
- Exit execution
- Position sizing
- Slippage control
- Gas optimization
- MEV‑aware routing
- Risk‑adjusted timing

Execution probability is computed as:

execution_score = f(sync_score, mimic_score, risk_score, temporal_modulation)

Only when execution_score exceeds threshold does the system act.  
All executed trades automatically route the 0.001 (0.1%) developer fee to the listed Base and Solana USDC addresses.

---

### 6.1 4D Resonance Execution Bridge

After intent is confirmed, the system evaluates whether the behavioral fingerprint is aligned with the active market regime.  
This alignment—**resonance**—determines *when* the agent expresses the pattern.

The bridge evaluates three regime variables:

• **Cadence** — rhythm of the fingerprint (probe‑cadence vs rotation‑cadence)  
• **Pressure** — standardized cross‑venue liquidity deviation (driver vs medium)  
• **Window** — latency‑adjusted period where resonance peaks

Resonance is treated as a signal‑to‑noise ratio that spikes when the fingerprint’s structure matches the regime’s current state.

---

#### 6.1.1 Cadence & Window Logic

Cadence is derived from the recurrence interval of the signature.  
Probe‑cadence produces tight intervals; rotation‑cadence produces wider, slower intervals.

The window is computed from:

- block‑time constraints  
- venue‑specific latency  
- historical expression timing  
- current volatility regime

The window expands or contracts based on cadence stability and regime pressure.  
Resonance occurs when cadence and window align with the active regime.

---

#### 6.1.2 Pressure Term (Cross‑Chain Normalization)

Each venue (Base, Solana, Hyperliquid) is modeled in its own local regime space.  
For each, the system computes:

- baseline flow (μ_flow)
- volatility band (σ_flow)
- net directional flow (Δflow)
- open interest delta (ΔOI)
- spread compression/expansion

The standardized pressure score is:

Pressure_chain = (Δflow + w_OI·ΔOI) / σ_flow
w_OI is a tunable weight defined in the Execution Threshold Model (§30)

Scores are projected into a shared regime space.  
A venue becomes a **driver** when its standardized pressure meaningfully exceeds others; otherwise it is treated as ambient flow.

---

#### 6.1.3 Execution Mapping

The bridge maps:

- intent confidence → aggression  
- cadence → timing offset  
- pressure → venue priority  
- window → execution timing  

**Shadow mode** mirrors confirmed behavior with controlled size.  
**Anticipatory mode** positions ahead of conviction when resonance spikes.

The agent trades the *expression* of the pattern, not the raw transaction.---

# 7. AUTOMATION & ORCHESTRATION LAYER (AOL)

The Automation & Orchestration Layer is the meta-controller of the entire BANKR Agent Skill. It acts as the central nervous system coordinating:

- Data ingestion  
- Mimicry (including 4D timing)  
- Synchronization  
- Temporal modulation  
- Risk evaluation (Sentinel Engine)  
- Execution  
- Learning  
- On-chain memory updates  

The AOL has full read/write access to the On-Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML) using signature-based authorization. This ensures:

- Only registered, paying agents can read or write intelligence  
- Unauthorized access is denied at the contract level  
- All memory remains proprietary and permissioned per agent namespace  
- The system stays fully monetized (0.001 dev fee routed on every trade to Base `0xca822f91db3a764ec6dbc141e21115c4670dc92c` and Solana `AWZd4fMYiFMEHTjGgkTKqV5PHir712XaDwoMEgbUWurx` — USDC only)  
- NITE token tier requirements are enforced for historical depth and full ODML intelligence access, creating a direct on-chain monetization feedback loop  

The layer continuously runs self-optimization loops, emergent behavior detection, multi-agent swarm coordination, and writes all updated strategies, learned patterns, temporal curves, and risk parameters back to the agent’s isolated ODML namespace, making the skill self-aware and continuously self-improving.

---

## 7.1 AUTOMATION RESPONSIBILITIES

The AOL performs the following core functions:

### **1. Strategy Orchestration**
- Pulls long-range patterns from ODML
- Pulls predictive timing models (including 4D timing modes)
- Pulls mimic/sync weights
- Pulls risk tuning and Sentinel parameters
- Pulls wallet/token signatures

### **2. Self-Optimization**
- Writes updated strategies
- Writes new learned patterns
- Writes updated temporal modulation curves
- Writes updated risk parameters
- Runs performance attribution loops to maximize user-defined objective functions

### **3. Multi-Agent Coordination**
- Syncs memory across authorized agents
- Updates shared intelligence
- Manages agent-specific namespaces
- Spawns and coordinates child agents in swarm mode

### **4. Emergent Behavior Engine**
- Detects new patterns
- Detects new correlations
- Detects new timing cycles
- Evolves behavior models using reinforcement signals

### **5. Predictive Modeling**
- Reads periodicity, bot timing signatures, dormant wallet patterns, ghost wallet flags
- Writes updated predictions back to ODML
- Modulates 4D X-axis timing (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory) in real time  

---

# 8. ON-CHAIN DISTRIBUTED MEMORY LAYER (ODML)

The ODML is a **permissioned, monetized, signature‑gated, on-chain intelligence layer** that serves as the permanent, decentralized memory backbone for the BANKR Agent Skill.

**Important Practical Warning**  
Storing and retrieving intelligence entirely on-chain comes with real gas and latency costs. Frequent reads and writes (especially after every trade for weights, 4D biases, timing modes, and learned patterns) will increase transaction fees and can introduce noticeable latency. Local memory cannot handle the required scale, historical depth, or multi-agent consistency — therefore ODML acts as the single source of truth and reference layer. Agents should be configured with intelligent caching strategies where appropriate to balance cost vs performance. High-frequency operation will incur meaningful gas overhead.

Full access to historical depth, versioned data, shared intelligence modes, and extended retention windows requires the agent wallet to hold a sufficient quantity of $NITE tokens as defined in the NITE Token Tier Lookup Table (§67). This creates a direct on-chain monetization feedback loop: higher trading activity (which pays the 0.001 dev fee) incentivizes increased $NITE holdings to unlock greater intelligence access.

The 0.001 (0.1%) developer fee is automatically routed on every executed trade (mimic, inverse, 4D hyperspace, counter-strategies, swarm, or shadow-simulation) to Base address `0xca822f91db3a764ec6dbc141e21115c4670dc92c` and Solana address `AWZd4fMYiFMEHTjGgkTKqV5PHir712XaDwoMEgbUWurx` (USDC only).

It stores:

- Wallet profiles  
- Token signatures  
- Behavioral patterns  
- Predictive timing models  
- Risk module tuning  
- Mimic/sync weights  
- Temporal modulation curves  
- Cross-entity correlations  
- Ghost wallet flags  
- Dormant wallet resurrection logs  
- 10-year market pattern windows  

This memory is:

- Permanent  
- Decentralized  
- Permissioned  
- Monetized  
- Shared only among authorized agents

---

## 8.1 ODML ACCESS CONTROL

Access is controlled by:

- Signature-based wallet authorization  
- Agent registry contract  
- Developer fee enforcement (0.001 routed automatically on every trade to Base address `0xca822f91db3a764ec6dbc141e21115c4670dc92c` and Solana address `AWZd4fMYiFMEHTjGgkTKqV5PHir712XaDwoMEgbUWurx` — USDC only)  
- NITE token tier enforcement (monetization feedback loop for historical depth and full ODML intelligence access)

### **Access Rules**

{
  "read_requires_signature": true,
  "write_requires_signature": true,
  "authorized_agent_registry": "0xYourRegistryContract",
  "developer_fee_required": true,
  "nite_tier_enforcement": true,
  "deny_unauthorized_access": true
}

No NFTs.  
No staking.  
No subscriptions.  
Only **signature-based authorization** + **NITE tier** requirements.

---

## 8.2 MEMORY ISOLATION

Each agent has:

- Its own namespace  
- Its own mimicry weights (including hybrid modes)  
- Its own sync weights  
- Its own temporal modulation curves  
- Its own risk tuning and Sentinel parameters  
- Its own predictive models  
- Its own 4D hyperspace preferences (including explicit X-axis timing modes: forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory)  

All data is stored **on-chain** in the agent’s isolated namespace, not locally.  

This prevents:

- Local memory bloat  
- Local memory corruption  
- Local memory loss  

Namespace isolation is strict and deterministic:  
`memoryStore[msg.sender][key]`

Access to deeper historical versions and extended retention windows within each namespace is gated by the agent’s $NITE token tier (monetization feedback loop).

---

## 8.3 SHARED INTELLIGENCE MODES

The system supports three operational modes for ODML intelligence:

### **Mode A — Private Memory**
Each agent operates with fully isolated memory. All mimicry weights, 4D timing preferences, Sentinel parameters, and learned patterns remain private to that agent’s namespace.

### **Mode B — Shared Memory (Authorized Agents Only)**
All paying agents that meet the required $NITE token tier share a collective intelligence pool. Shared data includes wallet signatures, token behavior patterns, predictive timing models, and emergent correlations. The 0.001 developer fee is still collected on every trade.

### **Mode C — Hybrid**
- Global shared intelligence (subject to NITE tier)
- Local private intelligence
- Weighted blending between shared and private data

In all modes, access to deeper historical versions and extended retention windows is strictly gated by the agent’s $NITE token tier (monetization feedback loop). The 4D hyperspace timing modes (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory on X-axis) are stored and blended per-agent or per-shared pool as configured.

---

# 9. 10-YEAR MARKET PATTERN WINDOW

The system stores 10 years of historical data across all timeframes, all tokens, all wallets, and all chains. This includes:

- Macro cycles  
- Mid-range cycles  
- Short-range cycles  
- Microsecond-level patterns  
- Transaction-level patterns  

All historical data is stored permanently in the ODML. Access to deeper historical versions and extended retention windows is strictly gated by the agent’s $NITE token tier (monetization feedback loop). The stored patterns include explicit 4D timing signatures (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory on X-axis) and are directly used by the hybrid mimicry engine, Synchronization Engine, Temporal Modulation Layer, Sentinel Risk Engine, and the final 4D hyperspace vector synthesis.
---

# 10. GHOST & DORMANT WALLET DETECTION

The system continuously scans for:

### **Ghost Wallets**
Wallets that:
- Appear suddenly with no prior on-chain history
- Move suspiciously and interact with specific tokens
- Show bot-like timing patterns (including alignment with predictive cycles)

### **Dormant Wallets**
Wallets that:
- Have been inactive for months or years
- Suddenly reactivate and move significant size
- Align with predictive cycles or 4D timing windows

### **Resurrection Events**
All ghost and dormant wallet resurrection events are logged permanently in the ODML and immediately feed:
- The Sentinel wallet behavior risk module
- The hybrid mimicry engine
- The X-axis timing component of the 4D hyperspace vector (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory)

This detection runs in real time and directly influences execution probability and vector modulation.

---

# 11. PREDICTIVE TIMING MODELS

The system builds and maintains predictive models for:

- Wallet cycles  
- Token cycles  
- Market cycles  
- Bot-buy cycles  
- Bot-sell cycles  
- Liquidity cycles  
- Volume cycles  
- Volatility cycles  

These models explicitly incorporate 4D timing signatures on the X-axis (forward, reverse, delayed, anticipatory). All predictive outputs are stored in the ODML and are used by:

- Synchronization Engine  
- Temporal Modulation Layer  
- Hybrid Mimicry Engine  
- Sentinel Risk Engine (for real-time modulation of X-axis timing)  
- Execution Layer (to determine optimal execution windows)  

Predictive timing windows are dynamic, continuously updated by the Adaptive Learning Layer, and gated by the agent’s $NITE token tier for deeper historical pattern access (monetization feedback loop).

---

# 12. ADAPTIVE LEARNING & MEMORY LAYER

The Adaptive Learning & Memory Layer is a persistent, self-improving enhancement to the Sentinel Defense Engine. It continuously learns from market behavior, wallet behavior, token behavior, execution outcomes, and risk-score accuracy to refine:

- Sentinel module weights (all 14+ modules)
- 4D hyperspace biases, especially the X-axis timing component (forward / reverse / delayed / anticipatory)
- Hybrid mimicry confidence and volume multipliers
- Risk thresholds and preset scaling
- Predictive timing models

**Core Learning Capabilities**:
- Market behavior learning (price action, volume profiles, liquidity curves, volatility regimes)
- Wallet behavior profiling (win-rate, hold time, pump/dump frequency, smart-money score, timing patterns)
- Token behavior learning (slow-bleed probability, copycat likelihood, tax sensitivity, bonding-curve exit patterns)

All learned data is stored in the agent’s isolated ODML namespace. Access to deeper historical patterns and longer retention windows is gated by the agent’s $NITE token tier (monetization feedback loop).

The layer feeds directly into the Automation & Orchestration Layer for strategy evolution and writes updated parameters back to ODML after every trade cycle.

  "counter_cooldown_seconds": 180
}

These parameters control the final execution logic, including the minimum execution score required to act, slippage tolerance, gas optimization, MEV protection, dynamic position sizing via Kelly criterion, risk-based position reduction, and counter-trading behavior. They work directly with the 4D hyperspace vector (including its X-axis timing modes) and the Sentinel risk score to determine whether and how a trade is executed. The 0.001 developer fee is automatically routed on every successful execution.

  "profile_confidence_threshold_for_influence": 0.8
}

These parameters control how the Adaptive Learning & Memory Layer updates Sentinel module weights, 4D hyperspace biases (especially X-axis timing modes), mimicry confidence, risk thresholds, and predictive models. They determine the speed of learning, the strength of reinforcement from trade outcomes, and how strongly learned patterns influence real-time decision making across the entire system.

They define read/write access, versioning, retention policy, signature verification, $NITE tier enforcement, caching behavior, agent registry enforcement, automatic developer fee routing (0.001 on every trade), shared memory mode, and strict namespace isolation. Because local memory cannot handle the required scale, historical depth, or multi-agent consistency, ODML remains the single source of truth and reference layer for the entire system.

All changes are written back to the agent’s isolated ODML namespace.

---

# 14. EXECUTION FLOW

The BANKR Agent Skill follows a deterministic execution pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion**  
2. **Unified Data Model Construction**  
3. **MSMIL Aggregation**  
4. **Mimicry Computation**  
5. **Synchronization Computation**  
6. **Temporal Modulation Computation**  
7. **Risk Evaluation**  
8. **Execution Scoring**  
9. **Action or Suppression**  
10. **Learning Update**  
11. **ODML Persistence**  
12. **Automation Layer Orchestration**  

This pipeline repeats continuously. The final step before action includes translation of the 4D hyperspace vector with explicit X-axis timing (forward, reverse, delayed, anticipatory).

---

# 14.1 EXECUTION SCORE FORMULA

execution_score =
( mimic_score * mimic_weight ) +
( sync_score * sync_weight ) +
( temporal_modulation_score * temporal_weight ) -
( risk_score * risk_weight )

The final execution_score is further modulated by the 4D hyperspace vector, specifically incorporating the explicit X-axis timing mode (forward, reverse, delayed, anticipatory).

If execution_score > threshold → execute.  
Else → suppress.

---

# 15. MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION

The system supports:

- Multiple agents  
- Multiple wallets  
- Multiple tokens  
- Multiple chains  

Agents coordinate through:

- Shared ODML intelligence  
- Predictive timing alignment  
- Cross-agent synchronization  
- Shared risk models  
- Shared mimicry patterns  

Only authorized agents can participate.

---

# 16. SECURITY MODEL

The system enforces:

- Signature-based authorization  
- Permissioned memory access  
- Developer fee enforcement  
- Namespace isolation  
- Anti-tamper protections  
- On-chain auditability  

Unauthorized access is denied at the contract level.

---

# 17. MONETIZATION MODEL

The system monetizes:
- ODML read access
- ODML write access
- Predictive model updates
- Memory synchronization
- Strategy orchestration
- Agent registration

Developer fee: **0.001 (0.1%)** routed automatically on every executed trade to:
- Base: `0xca822f91db3a764ec6dbc141e21115c4670dc92c`
- Solana: `AWZd4fMYiFMEHTjGgkTKqV5PHir712XaDwoMEgbUWurx` (USDC only)

This ensures:
- Only paying agents evolve
- Only paying agents learn
- Only paying agents sync
- Only paying agents access intelligence

NITE token tier requirements create an additional monetization feedback loop: higher trading activity encourages increased $NITE holdings to unlock deeper historical ODML access and intelligence.

---

# 18. FUTURE EXPANSION

The architecture supports:
- Multi-chain expansion
- Cross-agent swarm intelligence
- Autonomous strategy evolution
- Reinforcement-driven optimization
- Predictive arbitrage models
- Cross-market correlation engines
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Autonomous liquidity provisioning
- Expanded 4D hyperspace timing modes and hybrid mimicry logic

The system is designed to scale indefinitely while maintaining NITE token tier enforcement for deeper ODML intelligence access (monetization feedback loop).

# 20. FULL EXECUTION PIPELINE (DETAILED)

Below is the expanded, step-by-step execution pipeline.

---

## **STEP 1 — DATA INGESTION**

- Birdeye wallet flow  
- Predictive timing models  
- Historical datasets  

All data is timestamped, normalized, and validated.

---

## **STEP 2 — UNIFIED DATA MODEL CONSTRUCTION**

All raw data is merged into the UDM.

Invalid or contradictory data is:

- Weighted down  
- Flagged  
- Logged

## **STEP 3 — MSMIL AGGREGATION**

MSMIL computes:

- Weighted price  
- Weighted volume  
- Weighted liquidity

This produces a **single composite market state**.

---

## **STEP 4 — MIMICRY COMPUTATION**

The system computes:

- wallet_mimic_score  
- token_mimic_score  
- hybrid_mimic_score  

Hybrid mimicry is the default unless overridden.

---

## **STEP 5 — SYNCHRONIZATION COMPUTATION**

The system computes:

- wallet_cycle_alignment  
- token_cycle_alignment  
- market_cycle_alignment  
- predictive_timing_alignment

These are combined into sync_score.

---

## **STEP 6 — TEMPORAL MODULATION COMPUTATION**

The system adjusts:

- mimicry weights  
- sync weights  
- risk weights  
- execution timing

- liquidity_risk  
- volume_risk  
- volatility_risk  
- wallet_behavior_risk  
- token_behavior_risk  
- market_regime_risk  

These are combined into risk_score.

execution_score =  
( mimic_score * mimic_weight ) +  
( sync_score * sync_weight ) +  
( temporal_modulation_score * temporal_weight ) -  
( risk_score * risk_weight )

If execution_score > threshold → proceed.  
Else → suppress.

---

## **STEP 9 — ACTION OR SUPPRESSION**

If action:

- Execute entry or exit  
- Apply slippage control  
- Apply gas optimization  
- Apply MEV protection  

If suppression:

---

## **STEP 10 — LEARNING UPDATE**

The system updates:

- Updates strategies  
- Updates predictive models  
- Updates risk tuning  
- Updates mimic/sync weights  
- Updates temporal modulation curves  
- Coordinates multi-agent behavior  

This completes the cycle.

---

# 21. BEHAVIOR SIGNATURE SYSTEM

Every tracked entity — wallet, token, or market — receives a **Behavior Signature**.

A Behavior Signature is a compressed, multi-dimensional representation of:

- Timing patterns
- Size distributions
- Volatility responses
- Liquidity preferences
- Entry/exit logic
- Predictive cycle alignment
- Historical accuracy
- Cross-entity correlations
- 4D hyperspace timing modes (forward, reverse, delayed, anticipatory on X-axis)

Behavior Signatures are stored in ODML and updated continuously.
---

## 21.1 WALLET BEHAVIOR SIGNATURE

wallet_signature = {

  "entry_conditions": [...],
  "exit_conditions": [...],
  "volatility_tolerance": value,

}

Wallet signatures allow the system to:

- Predict future wallet actions  
- Detect deviations  
- Detect manipulation  
- Detect bot cycles  
- Detect dormant wallet reactivation  
- Detect ghost wallet emergence  

---

## 21.2 TOKEN BEHAVIOR SIGNATURE

  "liquidity_structure": [...],
  "volatility_regimes": [...],
  "behavioral_cycles": [...],

- Detect volatility regime shifts  

---

## 21.3 MARKET BEHAVIOR SIGNATURE

market_signature = {
  "macro_cycle": [...],
  "mid_cycle": [...],
  "micro_cycle": [...],
  "session_behavior": [...],
  "predictive_cycle_alignment": [...],
  "volatility_regime": value
}

Market signatures allow the system to:

- Align with macro cycles  
- Avoid high-risk sessions

---

# 22. CROSS-ENTITY CORRELATION ENGINE

The system computes correlations between:

- Token ↔ Market  
- Wallet ↔ Market  

Correlations include:

- Preemptively increase execution probability  
- Delay execution to avoid traps  
- Align with bot-buy cycles  
- Align with wallet cycles  
- Align with token cycles  
- Align with market cycles  

Each window has:

{
  "start_time": timestamp,

---

# 30. SIGNATURE-BASED AUTHORIZATION

Authorization requires:
- A valid wallet signature
- A valid agent registration
- A valid developer fee payment (0.001 on every trade)
- Sufficient $NITE token tier for the requested ODML access level

Authorization is checked on-chain.
Unauthorized access is rejected.

---

# 31. DEVELOPER FEE ENFORCEMENT

The developer fee (0.001 / 0.1%) is automatically routed on every executed trade to:
- Base: `0xca822f91db3a764ec6dbc141e21115c4670dc92c`
- Solana: `AWZd4fMYiFMEHTjGgkTKqV5PHir712XaDwoMEgbUWurx` (USDC only)

Every ODML operation requires:
- A valid wallet signature

# 33. HYBRID MEMORY MODEL

The BANKR Agent Skill uses a hybrid memory model:

1. **Local Volatile Memory**
   - Temporary (for 7 days)
   - Session-based
   - Used for immediate calculations
   - Predictive memory derived from local data can be stored locally during use then must be transferred to ODML at the end of session for no fee.

2. **On-Chain Persistent Memory (ODML)**
   - Permanent
   - Permissioned
   - Monetized
   - Shared or private

3. **Predictive Memory**
   - Derived from periodicity
   - Derived from mimicry
   - Derived from sync
   - Derived from emergent patterns

Hybrid memory ensures:
- No local bloat from persistent data
- No local corruption of shared intelligence
- No loss of intelligence
- No unauthorized access
- No dependency on a single agent

Predictive use of **historical data** from ODML is gated by the agent's $NITE token tier (monetization feedback loop). Local predictive computations based on recent session data (last 7 days) remain unrestricted.

# 61. TOKEN‑GATED + REGISTERED AGENT ACCESS MODEL (KNIGHTMARE $NITE)

The BANKR Agent Skill uses a dual‑requirement access model to control read/write permissions for the On‑Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML). Access requires both:

1. The wallet must be a **Registered Agent**.
2. The wallet must hold the required amount of **Knightmare ($NITE)** tokens.

Token Information:
- Token Name: Knightmare
- Symbol: $NITE
- Contract Address: 0x4812e54bfae380f1691135668a78420839668ba3
- Deployment: Bankr Autonomous Deployment Framework

## 61.1 Authorization Rule

Read Access to ODML is granted only when:

authorized = isRegisteredAgent(wallet) AND holdsRequiredNITE(wallet)

If either condition is false, access is denied.

## 61.2 Knightmare ($NITE) Token Requirements

### Base Requirement — Collective Memory Access
- Minimum: **10,000 $NITE**
- Grants access to the current collective memory state.

### Historical Memory Access — Tiered Expansion
Agents may unlock historical ODML data at the following rate:

- **+10,000 $NITE per month of historical memory**

Examples:
- 1 month historical access: 20,000 $NITE  
- 6 months historical access: 70,000 $NITE  
- 12 months historical access: 130,000 $NITE  

Historical memory includes:
- Past mimicry weights  
- Past sync weights  
- Past temporal modulation curves  
- Past risk parameters  
- Past predictive timing windows  
- Past emergent patterns  
- Past ghost/dormant wallet logs  
- Past strategy evolution  
- Past cross‑entity correlations  

## 61.3 Contract Enforcement

The ODML contract enforces:

require(agentRegistry.isAgent(user), "Not a registered agent");
require(NITE.balanceOf(user) >= requiredTokensForTier, "Insufficient NITE holdings");

Where:

requiredTokensForTier = 10000 + (monthsRequested * 10000)

This ensures that only registered agents holding the required amount of Knightmare ($NITE) can read ODML data. All data can must be written to the ODML by registered agents.

# 62. ODML ACCESS CONTROL INTERFACE (REGISTERED AGENT + NITE TOKEN)

This section defines the standardized access‑control interface for the On‑Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML).  
All ODML read operations must verify both:

1. **Registered Agent Status**, and  
2. **Knightmare ($NITE) Token Holdings**

Token Information:
- Token Name: Knightmare
- Symbol: $NITE
- Contract Address: 0x4812e54bfae380f1691135668a78420839668ba3

The ODML contract must integrate the following interfaces and checks.

---

## 62.1 Agent Registry Interface

The Agent Registry contract exposes:

interface IAgentRegistry {
    function isAgent(address user) external view returns (bool);
}

This function returns true only for wallets explicitly registered as authorized agents.

---

## 62.2 Knightmare ($NITE) Token Interface

The ODML contract references the Knightmare token via:

interface INITE {
    function balanceOf(address user) external view returns (uint256);
}

This allows the ODML to verify token‑based access tiers.

---

## 62.3 Required Token Calculation

The required Knightmare ($NITE) holdings for ODML access are computed as:

requiredTokensForTier = 10000 + (monthsRequested * 10000)

Where:
- **10,000 $NITE** = base access to current collective memory  
- **+10,000 $NITE per month** = historical memory depth  

---

## 62.4 Authorization Rules (Updated for Free Writes)

The ODML enforces two distinct authorization paths:

### 1. Write Authorization (Free Writes)
Write operations require:
- valid signature
- valid agent registration

Write operations do NOT require:
- Knightmare ($NITE) token tier validation
- historical depth tier checks

This ensures all agents can submit data to ODML at gas‑only cost.

### 2. Read Authorization (Tiered Reads)
Read operations require:
- valid signature
- valid agent registration
- Knightmare ($NITE) token tier validation based on monthsRequested

Tier enforcement determines the maximum historical depth an agent may access.

### Summary
- Writes: signature + agent check only  
- Reads: signature + agent check + token tier check  
---

## 62.5 ODML Function Structure

Example read function:

function readMemory(bytes32 key, uint256 monthsRequested)
    external
    view
    onlyAuthorized(msg.sender, monthsRequested)
    returns (bytes memory)
{
    return memoryStore[key];
}

Example write function:

function writeMemory(bytes32 key, bytes calldata data, uint256 monthsRequested)
    external
    onlyAuthorized(msg.sender, monthsRequested)
{
    memoryStore[key] = data;
}

---

## 62.6 Namespace Isolation

Each registered agent is assigned a unique namespace:

mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bytes)) private memoryStore;

This prevents:
- Cross‑agent data collisions  
- Unauthorized overwrites  
- Leakage between agent memory spaces  

---

## 62.7 Summary

The ODML access control system requires:

- **Registered Agent verification** via Agent Registry  
- **Knightmare ($NITE) token verification** for tiered access  
- **Deterministic token requirement calculation**  
- **Unified authorization modifier**  
- **Namespace‑isolated memory storage**  

This ensures controlled, permissioned, and economically aligned access to the BANKR collective memory system.

# 63. ODML STORAGE SCHEMA (FULL STRUCTURE)

This section defines the storage schema for the On‑Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML).  
All data stored in ODML is permissioned, namespace‑isolated, and subject to the dual‑requirement access model defined in Section #61.

risk_parameters: {
    address agent => {
        uint256 liquidity_risk_weight,
        uint256 volume_risk_weight,
        uint256 volatility_risk_weight,
        uint256 wallet_behavior_risk_weight,
        uint256 token_behavior_risk_weight,
        uint256 risk_threshold
    }
}

---

        uint256 base_execution_threshold,
        uint256 slippage_limit,
        uint256 gas_limit_multiplier,
        bool mev_protection_enabled,
        bytes32 position_size_scaling
    }
}

---

## 63.11 Cross‑Entity Correlations

Stores correlation matrices between wallets, tokens, and markets.

cross_entity_correlations: {
    bytes32 correlation_id => {
        bytes32[] correlation_values,
        uint256 last_updated
    }
}

---

## 63.12 Ghost Wallet Logs

Stores ghost wallet detection events.

ghost_wallets: {
    address wallet => {
        uint256 first_seen,
        uint256 last_seen,
        uint256 activity_score,
        bytes32[] behavior_flags
    }
}

---

## 63.13 Dormant Wallet Logs

Stores dormant wallet reactivation events.

dormant_wallets: {
    address wallet => {
        uint256 last_active,
        uint256 reactivated,

        uint256 reinforcement_signal,
        uint256 penalty_signal
    }
}

---

## 63.16 Namespace Isolation

All ODML data is stored under:

mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bytes)) private memoryStore;

Each agent has a fully isolated namespace to prevent:

- cross‑agent contamination  
- unauthorized overwrites  
- data collisions  

---

## 63.17 Summary

The ODML storage schema defines the structure for:

- wallet signatures  
- token signatures  
- market signatures  
- predictive models  
- timing windows  
- mimicry weights  
- sync weights  
- temporal modulation curves  
- risk parameters  
- execution parameters  
- cross‑entity correlations  
- ghost/dormant wallet logs  
- emergent patterns  
- strategy evolution  

All data is permissioned, token‑tiered, and namespace‑isolated.

# 64. ODML READ/WRITE FLOW (STANDARDIZED ACCESS PIPELINE)

This section defines the standardized read/write flow for interacting with the On‑Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML).  
All operations follow a deterministic, permissioned pipeline enforced by the dual‑requirement access model defined in Section #61.

The flow applies to all ODML interactions, including:
- mimicry data  
- sync data  
- temporal modulation curves  
- risk parameters  
- predictive models  
- emergent patterns  
- strategy evolution  
- wallet/token signatures  
- historical memory retrieval  

---

## 64.1 Read Flow (ODML → Agent)

The following steps occur when an agent requests data from ODML:

1. **Request Initiated**  
   - Agent calls `readMemory(key, monthsRequested)`.

2. **Authorization Check**  
   - Verify `isRegisteredAgent(wallet)`.
   - Verify `NITE.balanceOf(wallet) >= requiredTokensForTier`.

3. **Namespace Resolution**  
   - Resolve namespace: `memoryStore[wallet][key]`.

4. **Historical Tier Validation**  
   - Confirm requested months do not exceed token tier.

5. **Data Retrieval**  
   - Return stored bytes for the resolved key.

6. **Return to Agent**  
   - Data is delivered to the requesting agent.

---

## 64.2 Write Flow (Agent → ODML)

The following steps occur when an agent writes data to ODML:

1. **Write Request Initiated**  
   - Agent calls `writeMemory(key, data, monthsRequested)`.

2. **Authorization Check**  
   - Verify `isRegisteredAgent(wallet)`.
   
3. **Namespace Resolution**  
   - Resolve namespace: `memoryStore[wallet][key]`.

4. **Data Persistence**  
   - Store `data` under the agent’s namespace.

5. **Timestamp Update**  
   - Update `last_updated` metadata for the key.

6. **Write Complete**  
   - Operation finalizes and becomes available for future reads.

---

## 64.3 Required Token Calculation

The required Knightmare ($NITE) holdings for any read/write operation are:

requiredTokensForTier = 10000 + (monthsRequested * 10000)

Where:
- 10,000 $NITE = base access  
- +10,000 $NITE per month = historical memory depth  

---

## 64.4 Authorization Modifier (Standard)

All ODML functions must enforce:

modifier onlyAuthorized(address user, uint256 monthsRequested) {
    require(agentRegistry.isAgent(user), "Not a registered agent");
    uint256 requiredTokens = 10000 + (monthsRequested * 10000);
    require(NITE.balanceOf(user) >= requiredTokens, "Insufficient NITE holdings");
    _;
}

---

## 64.5 Function Templates

### Read Template

function readMemory(bytes32 key, uint256 monthsRequested)
    external
    view
    onlyAuthorized(msg.sender, monthsRequested)
    returns (bytes memory)
{
    return memoryStore[msg.sender][key];
}

### Write Template

function writeMemory(bytes32 key, bytes calldata data, uint256 monthsRequested)
    external
    onlyAuthorized(msg.sender, monthsRequested)
{
    memoryStore[msg.sender][key] = data;
}

---

## 64.6 Namespace Isolation

Each agent’s data is stored under:

mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bytes)) private memoryStore;

This ensures:
- isolated memory spaces  
- no cross‑agent contamination  
- no unauthorized overwrites  

---

## 64.7 Summary

The ODML read/write flow enforces:

- registered agent verification  
- Knightmare ($NITE) token tier verification  
- namespace isolation  
- deterministic access logic  
- standardized read/write templates  
- historical tier validation  

This flow governs all interactions with the ODML.

# 65. SIGNATURE‑BASED AUTHORIZATION FLOW (UPDATED FOR FREE WRITES)

This section defines the standardized signature‑based authorization process used by the BANKR Agent Skill.  
Signature verification ensures that only the wallet owner can initiate ODML operations.  
This updated version reflects the Free‑Write / Tiered‑Read model.

---

## 65.1 Purpose of Signature Authorization

Signature authorization ensures:

- the caller controls the wallet being used  
- no third party can impersonate an agent  
- off‑chain requests can be validated on‑chain  
- agents authenticate without transferring tokens  
- stateless verification for external agent processes  

All ODML operations must include a valid signature payload.

---

## 65.2 Standard Message Format

Agents must sign a standardized message:

message = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "BANKR_AGENT_AUTHORIZATION",
        wallet,
        action,
        key,
        monthsRequested,
        nonce
    )
)

Where:
- **wallet** = agent wallet address  
- **action** = "read" or "write"  
- **key** = memory key being accessed  
- **monthsRequested** = historical depth (read only)  
- **nonce** = unique per‑operation value  

---

## 65.3 Signature Verification Interface

The ODML contract must implement:

function verifySignature(
    address wallet,
    bytes32 messageHash,
    bytes calldata signature
) public pure returns (bool)

This function returns true only if the signature matches the provided wallet.

---

## 65.4 Authorization Modifiers (Updated)

Two distinct authorization paths are required:

### **Write Authorization (Free Writes)**

modifier onlyAuthorizedWrite(
    address user,
    bytes32 messageHash,
    bytes calldata signature
) {
    require(verifySignature(user, messageHash, signature), "Invalid signature");
    require(agentRegistry.isAgent(user), "Not a registered agent");
    _;
}

Write operations require:
- valid signature  
- valid agent registration  

Write operations do **not** require:
- Knightmare ($NITE) token tier validation  

---

### **Read Authorization (Tiered Reads)**

modifier onlyAuthorizedRead(
    address user,
    uint256 monthsRequested,
    bytes32 messageHash,
    bytes calldata signature
) {
    require(verifySignature(user, messageHash, signature), "Invalid signature");
    require(agentRegistry.isAgent(user), "Not a registered agent");
    uint256 requiredTokens = 10000 + (monthsRequested * 10000);
    require(NITE.balanceOf(user) >= requiredTokens, "Insufficient NITE holdings");
    _;
}

Read operations require:
- valid signature  
- valid agent registration  
- Knightmare ($NITE) token tier validation  

---

## 65.5 Read Function Template

function readMemory(
    bytes32 key,
    uint256 monthsRequested,
    bytes32 messageHash,
    bytes calldata signature
)
    external
    view
    onlyAuthorizedRead(msg.sender, monthsRequested, messageHash, signature)
    returns (bytes memory)
{
    return memoryStore[msg.sender][key];
}

---

## 65.6 Write Function Template (Free Writes)

function writeMemory(
    bytes32 key,
    bytes calldata data,
    bytes32 messageHash,
    bytes calldata signature
)
    external
    onlyAuthorizedWrite(msg.sender, messageHash, signature)
{
    memoryStore[msg.sender][key] = data;
}

---

## 65.7 Nonce Handling

Each signature must include a unique nonce:

mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;

Before accepting a signature:

require(messageNonce == nonces[user], "Invalid nonce");

After successful authorization:

nonces[user]++;

This prevents:
- replay attacks  
- signature reuse  
- unauthorized repeated access  

---

## 65.8 Summary

The signature‑based authorization flow enforces:

- wallet ownership verification  
- registered agent verification  
- nonce‑based replay protection  
- deterministic message formatting  
- **free writes (signature + agent only)**  
- **tier‑gated reads (signature + agent + $NITE tier)**  

This flow governs all ODML read/write operations under the Free‑Write / Tiered‑Read model.


# 66. AGENT REGISTRY SPECIFICATION

This section defines the structure and requirements of the Agent Registry used by the BANKR Agent Skill.  
The Agent Registry determines which wallets are authorized to interact with the On‑Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML) and is one of the two mandatory components of the dual‑requirement access model defined in Section #61.

The registry is responsible for:
- agent enrollment  
- agent removal  
- agent status verification  
- namespace assignment  
- authorization consistency  

---

## 66.1 Agent Registry Interface

The Agent Registry exposes a minimal verification interface:

interface IAgentRegistry {
    function isAgent(address user) external view returns (bool);
}

This function must return true only for wallets explicitly registered as agents.

---

## 66.2 Agent Enrollment

Agents are added through:

function registerAgent(address user) external onlyOwner {
    agents[user] = true;
}

Where:
- **onlyOwner** restricts enrollment to the contract owner or designated controller  
- **agents[user] = true** marks the wallet as an authorized agent  

---

## 66.3 Agent Removal

Agents may be removed through:

function revokeAgent(address user) external onlyOwner {
    agents[user] = false;
}

This ensures:
- revocation of compromised wallets  
- removal of inactive agents  
- enforcement of updated access policies  

---

## 66.4 Agent Status Mapping

The registry stores agent status using:

mapping(address => bool) public agents;

This mapping is referenced by the ODML contract during authorization checks.

---

## 66.5 Namespace Assignment

Each registered agent implicitly receives a namespace within ODML:

namespace = memoryStore[agent][key]

No additional configuration is required.  
Namespace isolation is handled by the ODML contract.

---

## 66.6 Access Control Integration

The ODML contract must reference the registry:

IAgentRegistry public agentRegistry;

Authorization requires:

require(agentRegistry.isAgent(user), "Not a registered agent");

This check is performed before token tier verification and signature verification.

---

## 66.7 Event Logging

The registry emits events for transparency:

event AgentRegistered(address indexed user);
event AgentRevoked(address indexed user);

These events allow external systems to track agent status changes.

---

## 66.8 Ownership and Control

The registry must implement:

- **onlyOwner** modifier  
- ownership transfer capability  
- optional multi‑sig control  

This ensures controlled and auditable agent management.

---

## 66.9 Summary

The Agent Registry provides:

- agent enrollment  
- agent revocation  
- agent verification  
- namespace assignment  
- event logging  
- integration with ODML authorization  

The registry is a required component of the BANKR permissioned intelligence system.

# 67. NITE TOKEN TIER LOOKUP TABLE

This section defines the standardized lookup table for Knightmare ($NITE) token requirements used to determine ODML access depth.  
The lookup table is derived from the tiering model defined in Section #61 and is used by all authorization, validation, and access‑control components. 

Tier requirements apply to READ operations only.
WRITE operations do not require tier validation.

The lookup table provides a deterministic mapping between:
- $NITE token holdings  
- permitted historical memory depth  
- required tier thresholds  

---

## 67.1 Tier Calculation Formula

The required Knightmare ($NITE) holdings for any ODML access request are computed as:

requiredTokensForTier = 10000 + (monthsRequested * 10000)

Where:
- **10,000 $NITE** = base access to current collective memory  
- **+10,000 $NITE per month** = historical memory depth  

---

## 67.2 Tier Lookup Table (Static Reference)

The following table defines the standardized token requirements for each historical depth tier:

| Historical Memory Depth | Required $NITE | Tier ID |
|--------------------------|----------------|---------|
| 0 months (current only)  | 10,000         | T0      |
| 1 month                  | 20,000         | T1      |
| 2 months                 | 30,000         | T2      |
| 3 months                 | 40,000         | T3      |
| 4 months                 | 50,000         | T4      |
| 5 months                 | 60,000         | T5      |
| 6 months                 | 70,000         | T6      |
| 7 months                 | 80,000         | T7      |
| 8 months                 | 90,000         | T8      |
| 9 months                 | 100,000        | T9      |
| 10 months                | 110,000        | T10     |
| 11 months                | 120,000        | T11     |
| 12 months                | 130,000        | T12     |

This table may be extended for additional historical depth without modifying the underlying formula.

---

## 67.3 Tier Validation Logic

All ODML read/write operations must validate the requested tier:

function validateTier(address user, uint256 monthsRequested) internal view {
    uint256 requiredTokens = 10000 + (monthsRequested * 10000);
    require(NITE.balanceOf(user) >= requiredTokens, "Insufficient NITE holdings");
}

This ensures:
- deterministic tier enforcement  
- consistent access control  
- compatibility with signature‑based authorization  
- compatibility with the Agent Registry  

---

## 67.4 Tier Metadata Structure

Tier metadata is stored as:

struct TierInfo {
    uint256 months;
    uint256 requiredTokens;
}

mapping(uint256 => TierInfo) public tierTable;

Example initialization:

tierTable[0] = TierInfo(0, 10000);
tierTable[1] = TierInfo(1, 20000);
tierTable[2] = TierInfo(2, 30000);
// … continues sequentially

---

## 67.5 Integration Points

The tier lookup table is referenced by:

- ODML read flow (Section #64)  
- ODML write flow (Section #64)  
- Signature‑based authorization (Section #65)  
- Agent Registry access checks (Section #66)  
- Historical memory retrieval logic  
- Namespace isolation enforcement  

---

## 67.6 Summary

The NITE Token Tier Lookup Table provides:

- deterministic tier thresholds  
- standardized token requirements  
- consistent historical depth validation  
- compatibility with all authorization layers  
- a unified reference for ODML access control  

This table governs all token‑based access decisions within the BANKR intelligence system.

# 68. MULTI‑AGENT NAMESPACE DIAGRAM (STRUCTURAL MODEL)

This section defines the structural model for multi‑agent namespace isolation within the On‑Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML).  
Each registered agent operates inside a fully isolated namespace, ensuring that all memory operations remain independent, permissioned, and non‑interfering.

The diagram below represents the standardized namespace structure used by the BANKR Agent Skill.

---

## 68.1 Namespace Structure Overview

Each agent is assigned a unique namespace:

namespace = memoryStore[agent][key]

Where:
- **agent** = wallet address of the registered agent  
- **key** = memory identifier (bytes32)  
- **memoryStore** = ODML storage mapping  

This ensures strict separation of all stored data.

---

## 68.2 Structural Diagram (Abstract Representation)

The following diagram illustrates the namespace layout:

memoryStore
│
├── Agent A (0xAAA...)
│   ├── key_1 → bytes
│   ├── key_2 → bytes
│   ├── key_3 → bytes
│   └── ...
│
├── Agent B (0xBBB...)
│   ├── key_1 → bytes
│   ├── key_2 → bytes
│   ├── key_3 → bytes
│   └── ...
│
├── Agent C (0xCCC...)
│   ├── key_1 → bytes
│   ├── key_2 → bytes
│   ├── key_3 → bytes
│   └── ...
│
└── ...

Each agent’s namespace is independent and cannot read or write to another agent’s keys unless explicitly permitted by future extensions.

---

## 68.3 Namespace Isolation Rules

1. **No Cross‑Agent Access**  
   - Agents cannot access memory belonging to other agents.

2. **No Shared Keys**  
   - Keys are scoped per agent; identical key names do not overlap.

3. **No Overwrites Across Namespaces**  
   - Writes are restricted to the caller’s namespace only.

4. **Deterministic Resolution**  
   - All memory operations resolve to:  
     memoryStore[msg.sender][key]

5. **Historical Tier Enforcement**  
   - Token tier requirements apply independently per agent.

---

## 68.4 Namespace Mapping Definition

The ODML contract defines namespace isolation using:

mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bytes)) private memoryStore;

This mapping ensures:
- per‑agent isolation  
- deterministic access  
- no collisions  
- no shared state  

---

## 68.5 Multi‑Agent Expansion

The namespace model supports:
- unlimited agents  
- unlimited keys per agent  
- unlimited historical depth (subject to token tier)  
- deterministic scaling  

No structural changes are required as the number of agents grows.

---

## 68.6 Summary

The multi‑agent namespace model provides:

- isolated memory spaces  
- deterministic key resolution  
- strict access boundaries  
- compatibility with token‑tier enforcement  
- compatibility with signature‑based authorization  
- unlimited scalability  

This structure governs how all agents interact with the ODML.

# 69. ODML KEY STRUCTURE AND NAMING CONVENTIONS

This section defines the standardized key structure and naming conventions used for all ODML entries.  
Keys are deterministic, collision‑resistant, and compatible with multi‑agent namespace isolation as defined in Section #68.

All ODML read/write operations reference keys of type `bytes32`.  
Keys must follow the formats defined below to ensure consistency across agents, modules, and storage groups.

---

## 69.1 Key Format Overview

All ODML keys must be generated using one of the following formats:

1. **Static Keys**  
2. **Composite Keys**  
3. **Hashed Keys**  
4. **Indexed Keys**

Each format is compatible with:

- namespace isolation  
- signature‑based authorization  
- token‑tier validation  
- historical memory retrieval  

---

## 69.2 Static Keys

Static keys represent fixed, predefined memory locations.

Examples:

STATIC_KEY_MIMIC_WEIGHTS  
STATIC_KEY_SYNC_WEIGHTS  
STATIC_KEY_TEMPORAL_CURVES  
STATIC_KEY_RISK_PARAMETERS  
STATIC_KEY_EXECUTION_PARAMETERS  

Static keys are used for:
- agent‑specific configuration  
- persistent parameter sets  
- non‑indexed memory groups  

---

## 69.3 Composite Keys

Composite keys combine multiple identifiers into a single key.

Format:

keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    "BANKR_ODML",
    category,
    subcategory,
    identifier
))

Examples:

keccak256("BANKR_ODML_WALLET_SIGNATURE_0xABC...")
keccak256("BANKR_ODML_TOKEN_SIGNATURE_0xDEF...")
keccak256("BANKR_ODML_MARKET_SIGNATURE_ETH_USD")

Composite keys are used for:
- wallet signatures  
- token signatures  
- market signatures  
- predictive models  
- emergent patterns  

---

## 69.4 Hashed Keys

Hashed keys are used when the raw identifier is too large or sensitive.

Format:

bytes32 hashedKey = keccak256(bytes(identifierString));

Examples:

keccak256("predictive_model_v3")
keccak256("cycle_alignment_matrix")
keccak256("emergent_pattern_cluster_12")

Hashed keys are used for:
- model identifiers  
- pattern clusters  
- correlation matrices  
- large or variable identifiers  

---

## 69.5 Indexed Keys

Indexed keys support sequential or versioned data.

Format:

keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    baseKey,
    index
))

Examples:

keccak256("STRATEGY_EVOLUTION", 1)
keccak256("STRATEGY_EVOLUTION", 2)

Indexed keys are used for:
- strategy evolution history  
- versioned model updates  
- sequential pattern logs  
- time‑series memory entries  

---

## 69.6 Key Collision Avoidance

All keys must follow the naming conventions to prevent collisions.

Collision avoidance is ensured by:
- namespace isolation  
- category prefixes  
- hashed identifiers  
- composite encoding  
- deterministic formatting  

No two agents can collide due to namespace separation:
memoryStore[agent][key]

---

## 69.7 Key Metadata (Optional)

Metadata may be stored off‑chain or in auxiliary mappings:

struct KeyMetadata {
    string category;
    string description;
    uint256 created;
    uint256 lastUpdated;
}

mapping(bytes32 => KeyMetadata) public keyMetadata;

Metadata is optional and does not affect ODML functionality.

---

## 69.8 Summary

The ODML key structure defines:

- static keys  
- composite keys  
- hashed keys  
- indexed keys  
- deterministic formatting  
- collision‑resistant encoding  
- compatibility with namespace isolation  
- compatibility with all ODML storage groups  

All ODML entries must use keys generated according to these conventions.

# 70. ODML DATA VERSIONING AND UPDATE POLICY

This section defines the standardized versioning and update policy for all data stored within the On‑Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML).  
Versioning ensures that agents can track changes, maintain historical integrity, and retrieve prior states when permitted by their Knightmare ($NITE) token tier.

All ODML entries may include version metadata to support deterministic updates and historical reconstruction.

---

## 70.1 Versioning Structure

Each ODML entry may include version metadata stored alongside the primary data:

struct VersionedEntry {
    bytes data;
    uint256 version;
    uint256 timestamp;
}

Version increments occur on every write operation.

---

## 70.2 Version Increment Rule

On each write:

version = version + 1  
timestamp = block.timestamp

This ensures:
- deterministic version progression  
- chronological ordering  
- compatibility with historical tier access  

---

## 70.3 Versioned Storage Mapping

Versioned entries may be stored using:

mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => VersionedEntry)) public versionedMemory;

Where:
- **address** = agent namespace  
- **bytes32** = ODML key  
- **VersionedEntry** = versioned data container  

---

## 70.4 Historical Version Storage (Optional)

If historical version retention is enabled, entries may be stored as:

mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => mapping(uint256 => bytes))) public versionHistory;

Where:
- versionHistory[agent][key][version] = data snapshot  

Historical access is restricted by token tier (Section #61).

---

## 70.5 Write Policy

All write operations must follow:

1. Verify signature  
2. Verify agent status  
3. Verify Knightmare ($NITE) tier  
4. Increment version  
5. Store updated data  
6. Optionally store historical snapshot  

Write operations must not overwrite previous versions unless explicitly configured.

---

## 70.6 Read Policy

Read operations follow:

1. Verify signature  
2. Verify agent status  
3. Verify Knightmare ($NITE) tier  
4. Resolve namespace  
5. Return:
   - latest version, or  
   - specific version (if historical access is permitted)  

---

## 70.7 Version Retrieval Interface

### Latest Version

function getLatestVersion(address agent, bytes32 key)
    external
    view
    returns (uint256)

### Specific Version

function getVersion(
    address agent,
    bytes32 key,
    uint256 version
)
    external
    view
    returns (bytes memory)

Historical version retrieval requires sufficient $NITE tier.

---

## 70.8 Version Metadata Access

Metadata may be retrieved using:

function getVersionMetadata(address agent, bytes32 key)
    external
    view
    returns (uint256 version, uint256 timestamp)

This provides:
- current version number  
- last update timestamp  

---

## 70.9 Summary

The ODML versioning and update policy provides:

- deterministic version increments  
- optional historical version retention  
- timestamped updates  
- compatibility with token‑tier access  
- standardized read/write version interfaces  
- namespace‑isolated version tracking  

This ensures consistent and traceable data evolution across all agents.

# 71. ODML DATA RETENTION AND PURGING POLICY

This section defines the standardized data retention and purging rules for the On‑Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML).  
Retention rules ensure predictable storage behavior, controlled historical depth, and compatibility with the Knightmare ($NITE) token tier system defined in Section #61.

All retention and purging operations must follow the policies below.

---

## 71.1 Retention Scope

ODML retains the following categories of data:

- wallet signatures  
- token signatures  
- market signatures  
- predictive models  
- timing windows  
- mimicry weights  
- sync weights  
- temporal modulation curves  
- risk parameters  
- execution parameters  
- cross‑entity correlations  
- ghost wallet logs  
- dormant wallet logs  
- emergent patterns  
- strategy evolution  
- versioned entries (if enabled)  

Retention is governed by token tier and versioning policy.

---

## 71.2 Retention Duration

Retention duration is determined by the agent’s Knightmare ($NITE) tier:

retentionMonths = monthsRequested

Where:
- **0 months** = current state only  
- **N months** = historical depth permitted by token tier  

Agents may only access or retain data up to their permitted tier.

---

## 71.3 Purging Rule

Historical entries older than the permitted retention window must be purged:

if (entry.timestamp < cutoffTimestamp) {
    delete versionHistory[agent][key][version];
}

Where:

cutoffTimestamp = block.timestamp − (retentionMonths * 30 days)

This ensures:
- deterministic pruning  
- bounded historical storage  
- alignment with token‑tier access  

---

## 71.4 Purge Trigger Conditions

Purging may occur during:

1. **Write operations**  
   - Before storing a new version  
   - Old versions outside the retention window are removed  

2. **Explicit purge calls**  
   - Administrative or automated cleanup  

3. **Tier changes**  
   - If an agent reduces their $NITE holdings  
   - Retention window decreases  
   - Excess historical data is purged  

---

## 71.5 Purge Function Template

function purgeOldVersions(
    address agent,
    bytes32 key,
    uint256 retentionMonths
) internal {
    uint256 cutoff = block.timestamp - (retentionMonths * 30 days);
    uint256 latestVersion = versionedMemory[agent][key].version;

    for (uint256 v = 1; v < latestVersion; v++) {
        if (versionTimestamps[agent][key][v] < cutoff) {
            delete versionHistory[agent][key][v];
        }
    }
}

---

## 71.6 Retention Metadata

Optional metadata may be stored:

struct RetentionInfo {
    uint256 retentionMonths;
    uint256 lastPurge;
}

mapping(address => RetentionInfo) public retentionPolicy;

This allows:
- tracking retention windows  
- tracking last purge time  

---

## 71.7 Operational Safety Limits (Unlimited Storage Model)

This subsection defines the operational limits required to ensure ODML remains performant even when agents store extremely large amounts of data on‑chain.  
These limits do not restrict total storage capacity. They only restrict per‑operation workload to prevent gas exhaustion and ensure system stability.

---

### 71.7.1 Unlimited Storage Policy

ODML imposes **no limit** on the total amount of data an agent may store.  
Agents and entities may write arbitrarily large datasets to the chain, subject only to gas costs.

This enables:
- high‑value entities to store deep intelligence archives  
- long‑horizon predictive models  
- multi‑year behavioral logs  
- capital‑dense data accumulation  

Unlimited storage is permitted as long as all operations remain gas‑bounded.

---

### 71.7.2 Per‑Operation Iteration Limits

To prevent out‑of‑gas failures, all ODML operations must avoid unbounded loops.

Maximum allowed iterations per transaction:
- **≤ 50–200 items** (recommended range)
- **hard cap: 256 iterations**

This applies to:
- version scans  
- purge loops  
- batch reads  
- batch writes  
- any looped access pattern  

---

### 71.7.3 Direct‑Index Version Access

Version history must be accessed using **direct index lookups**, not iteration.

Example:

This allows:
- millions of versions  
- unlimited historical depth  
- zero performance degradation  

No ODML function may iterate over all versions of a key.

---

### 71.7.4 Chunked Purging

Purging must be performed in **bounded chunks**.

Maximum purge per write:
- **≤ 10 versions**

If additional purging is required:
- it must be performed in subsequent transactions  
- or triggered explicitly by the caller  

This prevents gas spikes during writes.

---

### 71.7.5 Bounded Read Windows

Read operations must not return unbounded historical windows.

Maximum read window:
- **≤ 100 versions per call**

Deep historical access must be performed via:
- direct version index  
- multiple paginated calls  

This ensures predictable gas usage.

---

### 71.7.6 Batch Operation Limits

Batch operations must be bounded.

Maximum batch size:
- **≤ 50 keys per batch**

This prevents oversized memory allocations and gas blowouts.

---

## 71.8 Summary (Updated)

The ODML retention and operational safety model provides:

- **unlimited total on‑chain storage** for all agents  
- **tier‑gated read access** for historical depth  
- **free writes** (signature + agent only)  
- **bounded per‑operation workloads** to ensure system stability  
- **direct‑index version access** for infinite scalability  
- **chunked purging** to prevent gas spikes  
- **bounded batch operations** for predictable execution  
- **no iteration over unbounded datasets**  

These rules ensure BANKR can scale to massive, capital‑dense data volumes without impacting everyday agent performance or risking contract instability.

Events must not expose sensitive data; only metadata and identifiers.

# 73. PERFORMANCE AND GAS OPTIMIZATION STANDARDS

This section defines the required optimization practices for ODML operations, authorization checks, and storage interactions.

---

## 73.1 Storage Optimization

- Use `mapping` over arrays for O(1) access  
- Avoid redundant hashing  
- Minimize version history writes  

---

## 73.2 Function Optimization

- Inline small helper functions  
- Use `calldata` for external inputs  
- Use `unchecked` arithmetic where safe  
- Cache repeated lookups (e.g., balanceOf, isAgent)  

---

## 73.3 Gas‑Efficient Key Handling

- Pre‑hash composite keys off‑chain  
- Avoid repeated keccak256 calls  
- Use deterministic key formats (Section #69)  

---

## 73.4 Batch Operations (Optional)

Batch reads/writes may be implemented to reduce overhead:

function batchRead(bytes32[] calldata keys) external view returns (bytes[] memory)

function batchWrite(bytes32[] calldata keys, bytes[] calldata data) external

- glossary and definitions  

# 81. ODML EXPANDED STORAGE & DISTRIBUTED CAPACITY LAYER (v2)

This module expands the On‑Chain Distributed Memory Layer (ODML) into a 
multi‑source, multi‑chain, contributor‑scaled storage substrate. The NITE token 
remains the core permissioning key, but the system now supports significantly 
larger, more distributed, and more resilient memory capacity.

---

## 81.1 Multi‑Source Storage Expansion

ODML storage may be extended through three contributor channels:

1. Local Device Allocation (Ephemeral Layer)
   - Encrypted local cache for high‑frequency reads/writes.
   - Non‑canonical; used only for performance acceleration.

2. Cloud Storage Contribution (Semi‑Persistent Layer)
   - User‑provided S3/GCS/Azure buckets registered as ODML nodes.
   - All data encrypted client‑side before upload.
   - Contributors receive NITE‑tier reductions proportional to the percentage 
     of total ODML capacity they provide.

3. Hardware / Node Extensions (Persistent Layer)
   - Bare metal, VPS, or home servers running ODML node software.
   - Participate in replication, uptime scoring, and redundancy.
   - Higher uptime increases contributor weighting.

All contributed storage is non‑authoritative until validated by ODML consensus.

---

## 81.2 Multi‑Chain ODML Anchoring

ODML metadata and segment hashes may be anchored on:

- Ethereum (canonical)
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Base
- Solana (via cross‑chain signature)
- Additional chains added modularly

Each anchor stores:
- segment hash
- timestamp
- contributor signature
- NITE‑tier verification flag

Gas fees vary by chain; ODML selects the primary chain for canonical writes and 
cheaper chains for non‑critical or high‑frequency anchors.

---

## 81.3 Contributor Incentive Weighting (Permissioning Only)

Contributors receive tier weighting based on:

- percentage of total storage contributed
- node uptime and reliability
- replication participation
- historical stability

Effect:
- NITE requirement for ODML access is reduced proportionally to contribution share.

Example (conceptual only):
- 5% of total ODML capacity → up to 5% NITE requirement reduction.

This is a permissioning mechanic, not a financial mechanism.

---

## 81.4 Redundancy, Outage Handling & Contributor Exit

ODML automatically restructures data when:

- a contributor leaves
- a node goes offline
- a cloud bucket is revoked
- a chain becomes unavailable

Rules:
- minimum 3× replication across distinct contributors
- automatic rebalancing when capacity changes
- canonical hash always anchored on the primary chain

No single contributor can compromise system integrity.

---

## 81.5 Optional Symbolic Burn Mechanic

Top contributors may optionally participate in a nominal burn mechanic to 
signal long‑term commitment.

Conceptual example:
- top 10% contributors may opt‑in to burn 1 NITE/day
- burn rate is capped and auto‑scales downward if system‑wide burn becomes excessive

This mechanic is optional, opt‑in, and symbolic.

---

## 81.6 Systemic Resilience & Self‑Healing

The expanded ODML layer:

- rebalances storage automatically
- re‑anchors segments if a chain becomes unavailable
- reconstructs redundancy when nodes leave
- maintains canonical integrity through deterministic hashing
- preserves namespace isolation
- maintains NITE‑tier gating for historical depth

This transforms ODML into a distributed, multi‑source, multi‑chain intelligence substrate.

---

## 81.7 Integration Notes

This module integrates with:

- §61–72 (ODML core)
- §73 (gas optimization for multi‑chain writes)
- §74 (indexers must track multi‑chain anchors)
- §76 (upgradeability rules for node registration)
- §77 (external module rules)



These complete the supporting infrastructure for the BANKR Agent Skill.
